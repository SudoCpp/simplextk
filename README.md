## Why this project?
I've always been a fan of C++ and really didn't like languages like C# or Java. They always seemed a little too slow for what I wanted and required all this framework to get them to work properly. Then I was forced into a situation to use C#. I realized that people liked it because of all the tooling that was put into the language.

I looked at many websites comparing and contrasting C++ and C# and most of them said, if you want something fast use C++ and if you want something easier (because there are so many prebuilt tools) use C#. Then it recommended to combine them! As much as I love COM *cough* not *cough*, I thought, why don't I try to write a bunch of tools to make C++ easier.

C++ purists will say that it's not C++ because it is purely object orriented, and everything derrives from the object class. If you don't like the concept, the benefit of C++ is that you only include that things you want to use in your projects. If you want to try something that might make your life easier, feel free to give it a try.
